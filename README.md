#The Objectives

1. This is another project that is a part of my coursework requirements for the UC Berkeley Extension Coding Bootcamp. It aims to create a train scheduler using firebase as a database then AJAX and JSON for working with the data. JQuery and Javascript for manipulating html elements for the game mechanics and to display results.

1. This will also be some more practice at writing a README file using some basic Markdown on Github

1. I originally attempted the more challenging RPS for 2 players homework but got stuck in a few places and fast ran out of time. Nonetheless, this was still a good challenge working with time computations

##User Notes

1. This will be deployed and hopefully, it will have some entertainment value. It will be more to highlight what I've learned so far.

1. Please let me know if you have comments on how to make this app better or if you notice some bugs.

1. I would like to learn how to code better and if there's a better way of doing things, please don't hesitate to show me... and kindly explain to me as if I was a 12 year old :)

1. I am not expecting anybody needing help running this eventually but just in case, email monmaramba@yahoo.com.
